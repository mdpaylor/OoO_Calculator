# OoO_Calculator
This is a calculator application that has been created to demonstrate my knowledge of data structures as well as graphical and backend development. It is currently developed in Java, but will be converted into JavaScript soon.

#Next Objectives
 - Fully debug the backend portion of the calculator through the use of the automatic tester.
 - Forget the GUI because this will be solved when I learn JavaScript with React.
